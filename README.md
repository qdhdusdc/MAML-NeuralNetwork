# MAML-NeuralNetwork
	A simple-layer neural network and a multi-layer neural network which has a hidden layer are implemented based on the principle of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning. Use neural network to predict random sine function. The results will saved as png. 
	The results show the fitted curve according to the predicted points by neural network.
